        <h1 style="color :blue;">Welcome</h1> <!-- This element has only one CSS attribute set -->
        <h1 style="text-align: center;color:red">This heading has two attributes set</h1><!-- This element has two CSS attributes set -->

        <!-- Style attributes are hereditary, this means that if the style is moved to the BODY element, all childs will inherit this attribute as well -->
        <!-- We can also apply style to all tags from a single kind at the same time without adding style attributes on each one of them. From the HEAD tag we add a STYLE tag and add the tag element and the style attributes for it-->
        <h2>This header will have the style attributes from the defined at the HEAD tag</h2>
        <h2 id="h2Excluded">This header has an ID and it is styled separatedly through its ID on the HEAD tag</h2>
        <h3 class="multiH3">IDs can be used mutiple times but when more than one element needs to be included we can enclose it into a CLASS, this element style was defined inside a class element at the HEAD tag</h3>
        <h3 class="multiH3">This is also included on the class "multiH3"</h3>

        <div>
            The precedency for the style definition is as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>Inline. Style defined at the same line will preceed all others</li>
                <li>ID. ID will have the second precedency</li>
                <li>Class. Class will have the third place</li>
                <li>Type. Finally the type</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h1>CSS selectors</h1>
        <p>To inherit style attributes we can use CSS selectors in order to pass some specific styles relying on relation, meaning that for example we can set the style for childrens of a determined tag by using one of these selectors. On the following table we have these selectors and its designation.
