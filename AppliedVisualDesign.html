        <p style="font-size: larger;">Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help deliver your unique message.</p>

        <p style="font-size: larger;">In this course, you'll learn how to apply these different elements of visual design to your webpages.</p>

        <h1>Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property</h1>

        <p>This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.</p>

        <p>Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the <code>text-align</code> property.</p>

        <p><code>text-align: justify;</code> spaces the text so that each line has equal width.</p>

        <p><code>text-align: center;</code> centers the text</p>

        <p><code>text-align: right;</code> right-aligns the text</p>

        <p><code>And text-align: left;</code> (the default) left-aligns the text.</p>

        <h1>Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property</h1>

        <p>You can specify the <code>width</code> of an element using the width property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as <code>em</code>), absolute length units (such as <code>px</code>), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:</p>

        <p>Add a <code>width</code> property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px. Use the <code>fullCard</code> class to select the element.</p>

        <p>

                      text-align: center;
                    }
                    p {
                      text-align: justify;
                    }
                    .links {
                      margin-right: 20px;
                      text-align: left;
                    }
                    .fullCard {
                      width: 245px;
                      border: 1px solid #ccc;
                      border-radius: 5px;
                      margin: 10px 5px;
                      padding: 4px;
                    }
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h1>Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property</h1>

        <p>You can specify the <code>height</code> of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the <code>width</code> property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:</p>

        <p>Add a <code>height</code> property to the <code>h4</code> tag and set it to 25px.</p>

        <p>Note: You may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the test on this challenge.</p>

        <p>

                    }

        <h1>Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold</h1>

        <p>To make text bold, you can use the <code>strong</code> tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the <code>strong</code> tag, the browser applies the CSS of <code>font-weight: bold;</code> to the element.</p>

        <p>Wrap a <code>strong</code> tag around the text <code>Stanford University</code> inside the <code>p</code> tag (do not include the period).</p>

                      color: black;
                    }
                    .fullCard {
                      width: 245px;

                    .cardContent {
                      padding: 10px;
                    }
                    .cardText {

                        &#60p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at <code>&#60strong>Stanford University&#60/strong></code>.&#60/p>

            </pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Use the u Tag to Underline Text</h2>

        <p>To underline text, you can use the <code>u</code> tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the <code>u</code> tag, the browser applies the CSS of <code>text-decoration: underline;</code> to the element.</p>

        <p>Wrap the u tag only around the text Ph.D. students.</p>

        <p>Note: Try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.</p>

        <h2>Use the em Tag to Italicize Text</h2>

        <p>To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.</p>

        <h2>Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text</h2>

        <p>To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.</p>

        <p>Wrap the s tag around Google inside the h4 tag and then add the word Alphabet beside it without the strikethrough formatting.</p>

        <h2>Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element</h2>

        <p>You can use the hr tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content</p>

        <h1>Adjust the background-color Property of Text</h1>

        <p>Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a background-color to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. This challenge uses rgba() instead of hex codes or normal rgb().</p>

        <p>
          <pre>
            rgba stands for:
            r = red
            g = green
            b = blue
            a = alpha/level of opacity
          </pre>
        </p>

        <p>The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. rgba() is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely block out the background.</p>

        <p>You'll use background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1) for this challenge. It produces a dark gray color that is nearly transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1.</p>

        <h1>Adjust the Size of a Heading Element Versus a Paragraph Element</h1>

        <p>The font size of heading elements (h1 through h6) should generally be larger than the font size of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. You use the font-size property to adjust the size of the text in an element.</p>

        <h1>Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element</h1>

        <p>The <code>box-shadow</code> property applies one or more shadows to an element.</p>

        <p>The <code>box-shadow</code> property takes values for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>offset-x</code> (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),</li>
          <li><code>offset-y</code> (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),</li>
          <li><code>blur-radius</code></li>
          <li><code>spread-radius</code></li>
          <li>color</li> in that order
        </ul>

        <p>The <code>blur-radius</code> and <code>spread-radius</code> values are optional.</p>

        <p>Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.</p>

        <p>Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:</p>

        <code>box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);</code>

        <h1>Decrease the Opacity of an Element</h1>

        <p>The <code>opacity</code> property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.</p>


        <code>A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.</code>
        <code>A value of 0.5 is half see-through.</code>
        <code>A value of 0 is completely transparent.</code>

        <p>The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.</p>

        <h2>Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase</h2>

        <p>The <code>text-transform</code> property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.</p>

        <p>The following table shows how the different <code>text-transformvalues</code> change the example text "Transform me".</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <th>Value</th>
              <th>Result</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><code>lowercase</code></td>
                <td>"transform me"</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>uppercase</code></td>
                <td>"TRANSFORM ME"</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>capitalize</code></td>
                <td>"Transform Me"</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>initial</code></td>
                <td>Use the default value</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>inherit</code></td>
                <td>Use the text-transform value from the parent element</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>none</code></td>
                <td>Default: Use the original text</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h2>Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements</h2>

          <p>The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. In this challenge, you'll set the values for all h1 through h6 tags to balance the heading sizes.</p>

          <h2>Set the font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements</h2>

          <p>You set the <code>font-size</code> of each heading tag in the last challenge, here you'll adjust the <code>font-weight</code>.</p>

          <p>The <code>font-weight</code> property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.</p>

          <h2>Set the font-size of Paragraph Text</h2>

          <p>The font-size property in CSS is not limited to headings, it can be applied to any element containing text.</p>

          <h2>Set the line-height of Paragraphs</h2>

          <p>CSS offers the <code>line-height</code> property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.</p>

          <h1>Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag</h1>

          <p>This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.</p>

          <p>For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the 
           <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:</p>

           <p>
             <pre>
              a:hover {
                color: red;
              }              
             </pre>
           </p>

           <h1>Change an Element's Relative Position</h1>

           <p>CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.</p>

           <p>When the position of an element is set to <code>relative</code>, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:</p>

           <p>
             <pre>
              p {
                position: relative;
                bottom: 10px;
              }

           </p>

           <p>Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position.</p>

          <p>Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.</p>

                  position: relative;

          <h1>Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets</h1>

          <p>The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.</p>

          <h1>Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning</h1>

          <p>The next option for the CSS position property is <code>absolute</code>, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.</p>

          <p>One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.</p>

          <h1>Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning</h1>

          <p>The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.</p>

          <p>One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.</p>

          <h1>Push Elements Left or Right with the float Property</h1>

          <p>The next positioning tool does not actually use position, but sets the float property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or right of their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.</p>

          <h1>Change the Position of Overlapping Elements with the z-index Property</h1>

          <p>When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky), the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.</p>

          <p>Add a z-index property to the element with the class name of first (the red rectangle) and set it to a value of 2 so it covers the other element (blue rectangle).</p>

          <p>

          <h1>Center an Element Horizontally Using the margin Property</h1>

          <p>Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. One way to do this is to set its <code>margin</code> to a value of auto.</p>

          <p>This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you set the <code>display</code> property to <code>block</code>.</p>

          <h2>Learn about Complementary Colors</h2>

          <p>Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic and only the basics are covered in the following challenges. On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.</p>

          <p>The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.</p>

          <p>Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:</p>

          <pre>
            red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
            green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
            blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)
          </pre>

          <p>This is different than the outdated RYB color model that many of us were taught in school, which has different primary and complementary colors. Modern color theory uses the additive RGB model (like on a computer screen) and the subtractive CMY(K) model (like in printing). Read here for more information on this complex subject.</p>

          <p>There are many color picking tools available online that have an option to find the complement of a color.</p>

          <p>Note: Using color can be a powerful way to add visual interest to a page. However, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because users with visual impairments may not understand that content. This issue will be covered in more detail in the Applied Accessibility challenges.</p>

          <h2>Learn about Tertiary Colors</h2>

          <p>Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.</p>

          <p>Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.</p>

          <p>There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.</p>

          <p>Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <th>Color</th>
              <th>Hex code</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>orange</td>
                <td style="background-color: #FF7F00;">#FF7F00</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>cyan</td>
                <td style="background-color: #00FFFF;">#00FFFF</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>raspberry</td>
                <td style="background-color: #FF007F;">#FF007F</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h2>Adjust the Color of Various Elements to Complementary Colors</h2>

          <p>The Complementary Colors challenge showed that opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side. However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.</p>

          <p>This page will use a shade of teal (#09A7A1) as the dominant color, and its orange (#FF790E) complement to visually highlight the sign-up buttons. Change the background-color of both the header and footer from black to the teal color. Then change the h2 text color to teal as well. Finally, change the background-color of the button to the orange color.</p>

          <h2>Adjust the Hue of a Color</h2>

          <p>Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the <code>hsl()</code> property as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.</p>

          <p>Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In <code>hsl()</code>, hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.</p>

          <p>Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.</p>

          <p>Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.</p>

          <p>Here are a few examples of using <code>hsl()</code> with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <th>Color</th>
              <th>HSL</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>red</td>
                <td style="background-color: hsl(0,100%,50%);">hsl(0,100%,50%)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>yellow</td>
                <td style="background-color: hsl(60,100%,50%);">hsl(60,100%,50%)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>green</td>
                <td style="background-color: hsl(120,100%,50%);">hsl(120,100%,50%)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>cyan</td>
                <td style="background-color: hsl(180,100%,50%);">hsl(180,100%,50%)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>blue</td>
                <td style="background-color: hsl(240,100%,50%);color: hsl(0,100%,100%)">hsl(240,100%,50%)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>magenta</td>
                <td style="background-color: hsl(300,100%,50%);">hsl(300,100%,50%)</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

            <h2>Adjust the Tone of a Color</h2>

           <p>The hsl() option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the tone of a color. Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint of that color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting and shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of hsl() stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation percent changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is useful when you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it.</p>

           <h2>Create a Gradual CSS Linear Gradient</h2>

           <p>Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the <code>background</code> property's <code>linear-gradient()</code> function. Here is the general syntax:</p>

           <pre>background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);</pre>

           <p>The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a horizontal gradient (from left to right) and 45deg makes a diagonal gradient (from bottom left to top right). The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.</p>

          <pre>background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));</pre>

          <h2>Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element</h2>

          <p>The <code>repeating-linear-gradient()</code> function is very similar to <code>linear-gradient()</code> with the major difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern. <code>repeating-linear-gradient()</code> accepts a variety of values, but for simplicity, you'll work with an angle value and color stop values in this challenge.</p>

          <p>The angle value is the direction of the gradient. Color stops are like width values that mark where a transition takes place, and are given with a percentage or a number of pixels.</p>

          <p>In the example demonstrated in the code editor, the gradient starts with the color yellow at 0 pixels which blends into the second color blue at 40 pixels away from the start. Since the next color stop is also at 40 pixels, the gradient immediately changes to the third color green, which itself blends into the fourth color value red as that is 80 pixels away from the beginning of the gradient.</p>

          <p>For this example, it helps to think about the color stops as pairs where every two colors blend together.</p>

          <pre>0px [yellow -- blend -- blue] 40px [green -- blend -- red] 80px</pre>

          <p>If every two color stop values are the same color, the blending isn't noticeable because it's between the same color, followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with stripes.</p>

          <h2>Create Texture by Adding a Subtle Pattern as a Background Image</h2>

          <p>One way to add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern. The key is balance, as you don't want the background to stand out too much, and take away from the foreground. The background property supports the url() function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern. The link address is wrapped in quotes inside the parentheses.</p>

          <h2>Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Change the Size of an Element</h2>

          <p>To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function. The following code example doubles the size of all the paragraph elements on the page:</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              p {
                transform: scale(2);
              }              
            </pre>
          </p>

          <h2>Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover</h2>

          <p>The <code>transform</code> property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as <code>:hover</code> that specify a certain state of an element, the <code>transform</code> property can easily add interactivity to your elements.</p>

          <p>Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              p:hover {
                transform: scale(2.1);
              }              
            </pre>
          </p>

          <code>Note: Applying a transform to a div element will also affect any child elements contained in the div.</code>

          <h2>Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis</h2>

          <p>The next function of the <code>transform</code> property is <code>skewX()</code>, which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.</p>

          <p>The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.</p>

          <h2>Create a Graphic Using CSS</h2>

          <p>By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.</p>

          <p>You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side - the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape you see.</p>

          <p>In order to create a round object, the <code>border-radius</code> property should be set to a value of 50%.</p>

          <p>You may recall from an earlier challenge that the <code>box-shadow</code> property takes values for <code>offset-x</code>, <code>offset-y</code>, <code>blur-radius</code>, <code>spread-radius</code> and a color value in that order. The <code>blur-radius</code> and <code>spread-radius</code> values are optional.</p>

          <p>Manipulate the square element in the editor to create the moon shape. First, change the background-color to transparent, then set the border-radius property to 50% to make the circular shape. Finally, change the box-shadow property to set the offset-x to 25px, the offset-y to 10px, blur-radius to 0, spread-radius to 0, and color to blue.</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              &#60style>
                .center {
                  position: absolute;
                  margin: auto;
                  top: 0;
                  right: 0;
                  bottom: 0;
                  left: 0;
                  width: 100px;
                  height: 100px;
                  background-color: transparemt;
                  border-radius: 50%;
                  box-shadow: 25px 10px 0px 0px blue;
                }

          <h2>Create a More Complex Shape Using CSS and HTML</h2>

          <p>One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and in this challenge you'll create one using pure CSS. But first, you need to understand the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements. <code>::before</code> creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element; <code>::after</code> creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. In the following example, a <code>::before</code> pseudo-element is used to add a rectangle to an element with the class <code>heart:</code></p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              .heart::before {
                content: "";
                background-color: yellow;
                border-radius: 25%;
                position: absolute;
                height: 50px;
                width: 70px;
                top: -50px;
                left: 5px;
              }              
            </pre>
          </p>

          <p>For the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined <code>content</code> property. This property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the <code>content</code> property is still required, but it's set to an empty string. In the above example, the element with the class of <code>heart</code> has a <code>::before</code> pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with height and width of <code>50px</code> and <code>70px</code>, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% <code>border-radius</code> and is positioned absolutely at <code>5px</code> from the left and <code>50px</code> above the top of the element.</p>

          <p>Transform the element on the screen to a heart. In the heart::after selector, change the background-color to pink and the border-radius to 50%.</p>

          <p>Next, target the element with the class heart (just heart) and fill in the transform property. Use the rotate() function with -45 degrees.</p>

          <p>Finally, in the heart::before selector, set its content property to an empty string.</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              &#60style>
                .heart {
                  position: absolute;
                  margin: auto;
                  top: 0;
                  right: 0;
                  bottom: 0;
                  left: 0;
                  background-color: pink;
                  height: 50px;
                  width: 50px;
                  transform: rotate(-45deg);
                }
                .heart::after {
                  background-color: pink;
                  content: "";
                  border-radius: 50%;
                  position: absolute;
                  width: 50px;
                  height: 50px;
                  top: 0px;
                  left: 25px;
                }
                .heart::before {
                  content: "" ;
                  background-color: pink;
                  border-radius: 50%;
                  position: absolute;

          <h1>Learn How the CSS @keyframes and animation Properties Work</h1>

          <p>To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the <code>@keyframes</code> rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the <code>@keyframes</code> rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:</p>

          <p><code>animation-name</code> sets the name of the animation, which is later used by <code>@keyframes</code> to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.</p>

          <p><code>animation-duration</code> sets the length of time for the animation.</p>

          <p><code>@keyframes</code> is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of <code>@keyframes</code> and the animation properties:</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              #anim {
                animation-name: colorful;
                animation-duration: 3s;
              }
              
              @keyframes colorful {
                0% {
                  background-color: blue;
                }
                100% {
                  background-color: yellow;
                }
              }
              
            </pre>
          </p>

          <p>For the element with the <code>anim</code> id, the code snippet above sets the <code>animation-name</code> to <code>colorful</code> and sets the <code>animation-duration</code> to 3 seconds. Then the <code>@keyframes</code> rule links to the animation properties with the name <code>colorful</code>. It sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.</p>

          <p>Create an animation for the element with the id rect, by setting the animation-name to rainbow and the animation-duration to 4 seconds. Next, declare a @keyframes rule, and set the background-color at the beginning of the animation (0%) to blue, the middle of the animation (50%) to green, and the end of the animation (100%) to yellow.</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              &#60style>
                div {
                  height: 40px;
                  width: 70%;
                  background: black;
                  margin: 50px auto;
                  border-radius: 5px;
                }
              
                #rect {
                  animation-name: rainbow;
                  animation-duration: 4s;
                }
              
                @keyframes rainbow{
                  0% {
                    background-color: blue;
                  }
                  50%{
                    background-color: green;
                  }
                  100%{
                    background-color: yellow;
                  }
                }

          <h1>Use CSS Animation to Change the Hover State of a Button</h1>

          <p>You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.</p>

          <p>Here's an example of changing the width of an image on hover:</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              &#60style>
                img {
                  width: 30px;
                }
                img:hover {
                  animation-name: width;
                  animation-duration: 500ms;
                }
              
                @keyframes width {
                  100% {
                    width: 40px;
                  }
                }
              &#60/style>
              
              &#60img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/applied-visual-design/google-logo.png" alt="Google's Logo" />
              
            </pre>
          </p>

          <p>Note that ms stands for milliseconds, where 1000ms is equal to 1s.</p>

          <p>Use CSS @keyframes to change the background-color of the button element so it becomes #4791d0 when a user hovers over it. The @keyframes rule should only have an entry for 100%.</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              &#60style>
                button {
                  border-radius: 5px;
                  color: white;
                  background-color: #0f5897;
                  padding: 5px 10px 8px 10px;
                }
              
                button:hover {
                  animation-name: background-color;
                  animation-duration: 500ms;
                }
              
                @keyframes background-color{
                  100%{
                    background-color: #4791d0;
                  }
                }
              
              
              &#60/style>
              
              &#60button>Register&#60/button>
            </pre>
          </p>

          <h1>Modify Fill Mode of an Animation</h1>

          <p>That's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, causing the button to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.</p>

          <p>This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished. You can set it like so:</p>

          <code>animation-fill-mode: forwards;</code>

          <p>Set the animation-fill-mode property of button:hover to forwards so the button stays highlighted when a user hovers over it.</p>

          <p>
            <pre>
              &#60style>
                button {
                  border-radius: 5px;
                  color: white;
                  background-color: #0F5897;
                  padding: 5px 10px 8px 10px;
                }
