        <p style="font-size: larger;">Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help deliver your unique message.</p>

        <p style="font-size: larger;">In this course, you'll learn how to apply these different elements of visual design to your webpages.</p>

        <h1>Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property</h1>

        <p>This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.</p>

        <p>Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the <code>text-align</code> property.</p>

        <p><code>text-align: justify;</code> spaces the text so that each line has equal width.</p>

        <p><code>text-align: center;</code> centers the text</p>

        <p><code>text-align: right;</code> right-aligns the text</p>

        <p><code>And text-align: left;</code> (the default) left-aligns the text.</p>

        <h1>Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property</h1>

        <p>You can specify the <code>width</code> of an element using the width property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as <code>em</code>), absolute length units (such as <code>px</code>), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:</p>

        <p>Add a <code>width</code> property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px. Use the <code>fullCard</code> class to select the element.</p>

        <p>

                      text-align: center;
                    }
                    p {
                      text-align: justify;
                    }
                    .links {
                      margin-right: 20px;
                      text-align: left;
                    }
                    .fullCard {
                      width: 245px;
                      border: 1px solid #ccc;
                      border-radius: 5px;
                      margin: 10px 5px;
                      padding: 4px;
                    }
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h1>Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property</h1>

        <p>You can specify the <code>height</code> of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the <code>width</code> property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:</p>

        <p>Add a <code>height</code> property to the <code>h4</code> tag and set it to 25px.</p>

        <p>Note: You may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the test on this challenge.</p>

        <p>

        <h1>Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold</h1>

        <p>To make text bold, you can use the <code>strong</code> tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the <code>strong</code> tag, the browser applies the CSS of <code>font-weight: bold;</code> to the element.</p>

        <p>Wrap a <code>strong</code> tag around the text <code>Stanford University</code> inside the <code>p</code> tag (do not include the period).</p>

            </pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Use the u Tag to Underline Text</h2>

        <p>To underline text, you can use the <code>u</code> tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the <code>u</code> tag, the browser applies the CSS of <code>text-decoration: underline;</code> to the element.</p>

        <p>Wrap the u tag only around the text Ph.D. students.</p>

        <p>Note: Try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.</p>

        <h2>Use the em Tag to Italicize Text</h2>

        <p>To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.</p>

        <h2>Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text</h2>

        <p>To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.</p>

        <p>Wrap the s tag around Google inside the h4 tag and then add the word Alphabet beside it without the strikethrough formatting.</p>

        <h2>Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element</h2>

        <p>You can use the hr tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content</p>

        <h1>Adjust the background-color Property of Text</h1>

        <p>Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a background-color to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. This challenge uses rgba() instead of hex codes or normal rgb().</p>

        <p>
          <pre>
            rgba stands for:
            r = red
            g = green
            b = blue
            a = alpha/level of opacity
          </pre>
        </p>

        <p>The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. rgba() is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely block out the background.</p>

        <p>You'll use background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1) for this challenge. It produces a dark gray color that is nearly transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1.</p>

        <h1>Adjust the Size of a Heading Element Versus a Paragraph Element</h1>

        <p>The font size of heading elements (h1 through h6) should generally be larger than the font size of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. You use the font-size property to adjust the size of the text in an element.</p>

        <h1>Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element</h1>

        <p>The <code>box-shadow</code> property applies one or more shadows to an element.</p>

        <p>The <code>box-shadow</code> property takes values for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>offset-x</code> (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),</li>
          <li><code>offset-y</code> (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),</li>
          <li><code>blur-radius</code></li>
          <li><code>spread-radius</code></li>
          <li>color</li> in that order
        </ul>

        <p>The <code>blur-radius</code> and <code>spread-radius</code> values are optional.</p>

        <p>Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.</p>

        <p>Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:</p>

        <code>box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);</code>

        <h1>Decrease the Opacity of an Element</h1>

        <p>The <code>opacity</code> property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.</p>


        <code>A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.</code>
        <code>A value of 0.5 is half see-through.</code>
        <code>A value of 0 is completely transparent.</code>

        <p>The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.</p>

        <h2>Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase</h2>

        <p>The <code>text-transform</code> property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.</p>

        <p>The following table shows how the different <code>text-transformvalues</code> change the example text "Transform me".</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <th>Value</th>
              <th>Result</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><code>lowercase</code></td>
                <td>"transform me"</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>uppercase</code></td>
                <td>"TRANSFORM ME"</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>capitalize</code></td>
                <td>"Transform Me"</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>initial</code></td>
                <td>Use the default value</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>inherit</code></td>
                <td>Use the text-transform value from the parent element</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>none</code></td>
                <td>Default: Use the original text</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h2>Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements</h2>

          <p>The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. In this challenge, you'll set the values for all h1 through h6 tags to balance the heading sizes.</p>

          <h2>Set the font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements</h2>

          <p>You set the <code>font-size</code> of each heading tag in the last challenge, here you'll adjust the <code>font-weight</code>.</p>

          <p>The <code>font-weight</code> property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.</p>

          <h2>Set the font-size of Paragraph Text</h2>

          <p>The font-size property in CSS is not limited to headings, it can be applied to any element containing text.</p>

          <h2>Set the line-height of Paragraphs</h2>

          <p>CSS offers the <code>line-height</code> property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.</p>

          <h1>Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag</h1>

          <p>This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.</p>

          <p>For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the 
           <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:</p>

           <p>
             <pre>
              a:hover {
                color: red;
              }              
             </pre>
           </p>

           <h1>Change an Element's Relative Position</h1>

           <p>CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.</p>

           <p>When the position of an element is set to <code>relative</code>, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:</p>

           <p>
             <pre>
              p {
                position: relative;
                bottom: 10px;
              }              
             </pre>
           </p>

           <p>Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position.</p>

          <p>Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom.

          <h1>Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets</h1>

          <p>The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.</p>

          <h1>Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning</h1>

          <p>The next option for the CSS position property is <code>absolute</code>, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.</p>

          <p>One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.</p>

          <h1>Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning</h1>

          <p>The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.</p>

          <p>One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.</p>

          <h1>Push Elements Left or Right with the float Property</h1>

          <p>The next positioning tool does not actually use position, but sets the float property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or right of their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.</p>

          <h1>Change the Position of Overlapping Elements with the z-index Property</h1>

          <p>When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky), the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.</p>

          <p>Add a z-index property to the element with the class name of first (the red rectangle) and set it to a value of 2 so it covers the other element (blue rectangle).</p>
