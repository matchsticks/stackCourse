            <h2>Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility</h2>

            <p>You've likely seen an alt attribute on an img tag in other challenges. alt text describes the image's content and provides a text-alternative for it. An alt attribute helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. Search engines also use it to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:</p>

            <code>&#60img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo"></code>

            <p>People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.</p>

            <p>Good alt text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.</p>

            <p>Camper Cat happens to be both a coding ninja and an actual ninja, who is building a website to share his knowledge. The profile picture he wants to use shows his skills and should be appreciated by all site visitors. Add an alt attribute in the img tag, that explains Camper Cat is doing karate. (The image src doesn't link to an actual file, so you should see the alt text in the display.)</p>
            
            <h2>Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank</h2>

            <p>In the last challenge, you learned that including an alt attribute when using img tags is mandatory. However, sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only. In these cases, alt text may seem redundant or unnecessary.</p>

            <p>When an image is already explained with text content or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:</p>

            <code>&#60img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt=""></code>

            <p>Background images usually fall under the 'decorative' label as well. However, they are typically applied with CSS rules, and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process.</p>

            <p>Note: For images with a caption, you may still want to include alt text since it helps search engines catalog the image's content.</p>

            <p>Camper Cat has coded a skeleton page for the blog part of his website. He's planning to add a visual break between his two articles with a decorative image of a samurai sword. Add an alt attribute to the img tag and set it to an empty string. (Note that the image src doesn't link to an actual file - don't worry that there are no swords showing in the display.)</p>

            <h2>Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Content</h2>

            <p>Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.</p>

            <p>Semantic meaning means that the tag you use around content indicates the type of information it contains.</p>

            <p>If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to put the conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline. It should be its own section. Similarly, the heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content.</p>

            <p>Headings with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections of the previous one.</p>

            <p>As an example, a page with an h2 element followed by several subsections labeled with h4 elements would confuse a screen reader user. With six choices, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you can use CSS to edit the relative sizing.</p>

            <p>As an example, a page with an h2 element followed by several subsections labeled with h4 elements would confuse a screen reader user. With six choices, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you can use CSS to edit the relative sizing.</p>

            <p>Camper Cat wants a page on his site dedicated to becoming a ninja. Help him fix the headings so his markup gives semantic meaning to the content, and shows the proper parent-child relationships of his sections. Change all the h5 tags to the proper heading level to indicate they are subsections of the h2 ones. Use h3 tags for the purpose.</p>

            <h1>Jump Straight to the Content Using the main Element</h1>

            <p>HTML5 introduced several new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. These tags include <code>main</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>article</code>, and <code>section</code>, among others.</p>

            <p>By default, a browser renders these elements similar to the humble div. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning to your markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.</p>

            <p>The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information related to your page's central topic. It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.</p>

            <p>The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to navigate to the main content quickly. If you've ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using the main tag automatically gives assistive devices that functionality.</p>

            <p>Camper Cat has some big ideas for his ninja weapons page. Help him set up his markup by adding opening and closing main tags between the header and footer (covered in other challenges). Keep the main tags empty for now.</p>

            <h1>Wrap Content in the article Element</h1>

            <p><code>article</code> is another one of the new HTML5 elements that add semantic meaning to your markup. <code>article</code> is a sectioning element and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.</p>

            <p>Determining whether content can stand alone is usually a judgment call, but you can use a couple of simple tests. Ask yourself if you removed all surrounding context, would that content still make sense? Similarly, for text, would the content hold up if it were in an RSS feed?</p>

            <p>Remember that folks using assistive technologies rely on organized, semantically meaningful markup to better understand your work.</p>

            <p>Note: The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.</p>

            <p><code>&#60div></code> - groups content <code>&#60section></code> - groups related content <code>&#60article></code> - groups independent, self-contained content</p>
            
            <p>Camper Cat used article tags to wrap the posts on his blog page, but he forgot to use them around the top one. Change the div tag to use an article tag instead.</p>

            <h1>Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the header Landmark</h1>

            <p>The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag. It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.</p>

            <p><code>header</code> shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with <code>main</code>, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.</p>

            Note: The <code>header</code> is meant for use in the <code>body</code> tag of your HTML document. It is different than the <code>head</code> element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.

            <h2>Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the nav Landmark</h2>

            <p>The <code>nav</code> element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.</p>

            <p>If there are repeated site links at the bottom of the page, it isn't necessary to markup those with a <code>nav</code> tag as well. Using a <code>footer</code> (covered in the next challenge) is sufficient.</p>

            <h2>Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the footer Landmark</h2>

            <p>Similar to <code>header</code> and <code>nav</code>, the <code>footer</code> element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.</p>

            <h2>Improve Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element</h2>

            <p>HTML5's <code>audio</code> element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.</p>

            <p>The <code>audio</code> tag supports the <code>controls</code> attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.</p>

            <p>Here's an example:</p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                    &#60audio id="meowClip" controls>
                        &#60source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                        &#60source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
                    &#60/audio>
                      
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>Note: Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.</p>

            <h2>Improve Chart Accessibility with the figure Element</h2>

            <p>HTML5 introduced the <code>figure</code> element and the related <code>figcaption</code>. Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. Wrapping these elements together gives a two-fold accessibility boost by semantically grouping related content and providing a text alternative explaining the <code>figure</code>.</p>

            <p>For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments. Another challenge covers how to move a table version of the chart's data off-screen (using CSS) for screen reader users.</p>

            <p>Here's an example - note that the <code>figcaption</code> goes inside the <code>figure</code> tags and can be combined with other elements:</p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                    &#60figure>
                        &#60img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo of Camper Cat executing a roundhouse kick">
                        &#60br>
                        &#60figcaption>
                          Master Camper Cat demonstrates proper form of a roundhouse kick.
                        &#60/figcaption>
                    &#60/figure>  
                </pre>
            </p>

            <h2>Improve Form Field Accessibility with the label Element</h2>

            <p>Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names and attributes. The next several challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.</p>

            <p>The <code>label</code> tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The <code>for</code> attribute on a <code>label</code> tag explicitly associates that <code>label</code> with the form control and is used by screen readers.</p>

            <p>You learned about radio buttons and their labels in a lesson in the Basic HTML section. In that lesson, we wrapped the radio button input element inside a <code>label</code> element along with the label text in order to make the text clickable. Another way to achieve this is by using the <code>for</code> attribute, as explained in this lesson.</p>

            <p>The value of the <code>for</code> attribute must be the same as the value of the <code>id</code> attribute of the form control. Here's an example:</p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                    &#60form>
                        &#60label for="name">Name:&#60/label>
                        &#60input type="text" id="name" name="name">
                    &#60/form>
                      
                </pre>
            </p>

            <h2>Wrap Radio Buttons in a fieldset Element for Better Accessibility</h2>

            <p>The next form topic covers the accessibility of radio buttons. Each choice is given a <code>label</code> with a <code>for</code> attribute tying to the <code>id</code> of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.</p>

            <p>The <code>fieldset</code> tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It often uses a <code>legend</code> tag to provide a description for the grouping, which screen readers read for each choice in the <code>fieldset</code> element.</p>

            <p>The <code>fieldset</code> wrapper and <code>legend</code> tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender selection. Using a label with the for attribute for each radio button is sufficient.</p>

            <p>Here's an example:</p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                    &#60form>
                        &#60fieldset>
                          &#60legend>Choose one of these three items:&#60/legend>
                          &#60input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
                          &#60label for="one">Choice One&#60/label>&#60br>
                          &#60input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
                          &#60label for="two">Choice Two&#60/label>&#60br>
                          &#60input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
                          &#60label for="three">Choice Three&#60/label>
                        &#60/fieldset>
                      &#60/form>
                </pre>
            </p>

            <h2>Add an Accessible Date Picker</h2>

            <p>Forms often include the <code>input</code> field, which can be used to create several different form controls. The <code>type</code> attribute on this element indicates what kind of <code>input</code> element will be created.</p>
            
            <p>You may have noticed the <code>text</code> and <code>submit</code> input types in prior challenges, and HTML5 introduced an option to specify a <code>date</code> field. Depending on browser support, a date picker shows up in the <code>input</code> field when it's in focus, which makes filling in a form easier for all users.</p>

            <p>For older browsers, the type will default to <code>text</code>, so it helps to show users the expected date format in the <code>label</code> or <code>placeholder</code> text just in case.</p>

            <p>Here's an example:</p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                    &#60label for="input1">Enter a date:&#60/label>
                    &#60input type="date" id="input1" name="input1">
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                    &#60body>

            <h2>Standardize Times with the HTML5 datetime Attribute</h2>

            <p>Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also introduced the <code>time</code> element along with a <code>datetime</code> attribute to standardize times. The <code>time</code> element is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. A <code>datetime</code> attribute holds a valid format of that date. This is the value accessed by assistive devices. It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's informally or colloquially written in the text.</p>

            <p>Here's an example:</p>

            <p>
                <pre>
